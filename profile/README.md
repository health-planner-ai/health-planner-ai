# Welcome to Our AI-Powered Healthcare Project! 🌟

We’re thrilled to introduce our innovative project, aimed at transforming personal healthcare and making healthier living more achievable for everyone. Below, you'll find all the essential details about our mission, vision, and how you can contribute!

## 🛑 The Problem 

One of life’s biggest challenges is maintaining good habits while avoiding harmful ones. Many of us find ourselves stuck in destructive cycles, whether it’s dealing with serious addictions like substance abuse or less severe habits like overindulging in sugar or gaming. Breaking free from these patterns requires tremendous courage, and it’s often difficult to do it alone.

## 🚀 Our Solution 

That’s where our **AI-powered app** comes in!  
Our mission is to empower individuals to overcome harmful habits and make healthier lifestyle choices. While the journey is tough, our app acts as a personal support system—helping users stay on track with reminders, plans, and actionable insights.

## 🛠️ How It Works 

Our app features an intelligent agent that helps users set goals and provides a clear roadmap to achieve them. Here’s what it offers:

### 🌟 Features
1. **Personalized Roadmaps**  
   - Tailored diet plans, to-do lists, timetables, and more, all customized to user goals.
   
2. **Diet Plan Generation**  
   - Example: A user says, “I want to lose weight.”  
     The app creates a diet plan based on local food availability. Users can also customize their plans.

3. **Conversational Chat Widget**  
   - Type “I’m gonna eat something sweet,” and the AI might suggest healthier alternatives, gently guiding users toward better choices.

4. **Addiction Recovery Tools**  
   - Users can make personal promises (e.g., “Stay clean for 30 days”), with reminders about the consequences of giving in to cravings.  
   - Motivational quotes tailored to their journey, such as “Rule #1: Don’t lie to yourself.”

5. **Reward System**  
   - Celebrate small wins by rewarding yourself for resisting cravings or bouncing back after setbacks.

## 📈 Future Plans 

For our **MVP (Minimum Viable Product)**, we’ll build a **web application** using the **Next.js framework**.  
After the MVP, we plan to:  
1. Develop a **mobile application** using **React Native**.  
2. Introduce a **subscription-based model** to cover expenses and sustain development.

## 🤝 How You Can Contribute 

We believe in the power of community and welcome contributions from people with diverse skills and expertise. Even small contributions can make a big impact! Here's how you can help:

### Roles We’re Looking For:
1. **Web/Mobile Developers**  
   - Skills in **Next.js**, **React**, or **React Native**.

2. **UI/UX Designers**  
   - Experience with tools like **Figma**, **Sketch**, or **Adobe Photoshop**.

3. **Psychologists/Behavioral Experts**
